Hangman With React

Live version:
https://hangman-react-c42b4b.netlify.app/

I build this app as a React exercise using React useState Hook. React keeps track of the current word, the letters selected(wrong or correct) and if the game has been won or lost.
 Everytime you start the game it will get a random word and you should try guess it. 
 -If you select a wrong letter the wrong letters counter will increse and display the letter you have clicked. It will also update the hangman image depending on the number of wrong guesses.
 -If you select a correct letter then it will instantly update 
 Everytime you select a letter , it will disable that letter button so you cant select it again.
