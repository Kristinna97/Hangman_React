## Hangman with React 


[You can see live verion of the app on the following link](https://hangman-react-c42b4b.netlify.app/)
<br>

This is a classic Hangman game. I build this app as a React exercise using React useState Hook. React keeps track of the current word, the letters selected(wrong or correct) and if the game has been won or lost.
<br>
 Everytime you start the game it will get a random word froma  predefined list and you should try guess it. <br>
 -If you select a wrong letter the wrong letters counter will increse and display the letter you have clicked. It will also update the hangman image depending on the number of wrong guesses.
 -If you select a correct letter then it will instantly update the word you are trying to guess<br>
 
 Everytime you select a letter , it will disable that letter button so you cant select it again.
